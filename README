This repository was split from the Enumdroid repository using the command:

  git filter-branch --prune-empty --tree-filter \
    'find * -type f | egrep -v "DDDS|^LICENSE|^TODO" | xargs rm -f .project .classpath ' HEAD

so that it can be used as a library JAR in any type of project, not just
on Android.

It can be released to Sonatype using:

  mvn deploy -DperformRelease=true \
      -Durl=https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2/ \
      -DrepositoryId=sonatype-nexus-staging

The original project URL was on Google Code:
  https://code.google.com/p/enumdroid/
and migrated to Github:
  https://github.com/raybellis/enumdroid
